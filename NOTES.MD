- Describe in your own words what is z-score and Min-Max scaling and why would we need to use such normalization methods? describe by example, if possible.
```
Z-Score : Is how many standard deviation a data point is away from the mean Z-score = (X - mean ) / SD .
Min Max Scaling : Is normalization technique in which we fit the data in a pre-defined boundary in the range between 0 to 1 Xscaled = ( X - min(x) ) / max(x) - min(x) ) .
Normalization is a set of techniques we apply on data, espically when they are coming from different scale, otherwise it may lead into errors in decision or inappropriate decissions.
Example Distance in Miles and Km the units is differenet but you can compare them by using normlization techniques.

- We used Junit5 in our test cases, describe in your own words why would we use such library? 
what is unit testing and why would we use it?
```
Unit testing is like representative tests that covers logic or business in our code.
Using Junit test to make sure that all business invariants are not broken when ever there is a code change .
Using @BeforeEach to excutes the methods in an object before each test case in our test class.
```
- What is the IDE did you use?
```
IntelliJ Community Edition .
```

- Name the Java APIs you used?
```
Java io API , Java math API .
```

- Mention down any difficulties or concerns you faced while working on the task. Your feedback is appreciated :D.
```
Finding the suitable immplementation for the variance method to get the accurate rounding result.
```

- If you implement any of the bonus points, please mentioned it in this file
```
Provide an executable jar file.
```

- Did this task enrich technical skills or knowledge? If yes, tell us how: 
```
Yes, The task helped me to know more about Normalization Technique , Why and When we should use it.
Also helped me to keep on track with writing code and debugging.
```
